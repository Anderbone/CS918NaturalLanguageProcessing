Read\u2026 \r \nTim Ernst grew up in Williamsville playing video games like \u201cMega Man\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d on his console, and \u201cUltima\u201d and \u201cWarcraft\u201d on his computer. \n\n\u201cI loved them. They were something I just saw so much potential in,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cIt was always heartbreaking to play a game that was terrible. And if you played one that was amazing, it was just an unbelievable experience. \n\n\u201d \n\nToday, he gets to play \u2013 and design, and develop \u2013 video games for a living. Ernst, 34, is general manager of Kabam Games, where he oversees about 100 employees in the company\u2019s San Francisco development studio. \n\nHe\u2019s playing a leading role in the company\u2019s latest mobile game, \u201cStar Wars: Uprising,\u201d which came out Thursday and is tied to the eagerly awaited next installment in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie franchise, set for release in December. \n\nKabam has found a niche in making interactive, role-playing games for smartphones and tablets. The games are free to download and play but offer users the chance to pay for additional items within the game. \n\nIt\u2019s one segment of the massive, highly competitive video-game market, in which Ernst got his start with an internship at Ubisoft while studying at Yale University. He later worked at Sega of America and Bedlam Games before joining Kabam four years ago. \n\nThe Canisius High School graduate spoke to The News during a recent trip to Western New York, where he visited family and tried to squeeze in stops at Duff\u2019s Famous Wings, Gabriel\u2019s Gate, Mighty Taco, Wegmans and other hometown favorites. \n\nQ: Is making video games work? \n\nA: Clearly we\u2019re not just playing games. We, to a certain extent, do rocket science inside of video games. But it\u2019s sure enjoyable \u2013 it\u2019s an industry full of passionate people. \n\nQ: Kabam\u2019s niche is in role-playing games, or RPGs, for mobile devices. What are they? \n\nA: A role-playing game is really a video game world. It\u2019s got to be complete, with people you talk to, a story. But your character, your customization, your choices, as well as how you interact with both people in the game, and other people playing the game, is what makes the genre unique. \n\nQ: Are role-playing games a small part of the market compared to console and PC games? \n\nA: No, it is it not a small segment of the overall industry. In fact, multiple games last year made over $1 billion themselves. So, there has been success. And the people that have been successful have stayed at the top for a long period of time. It\u2019s also a growth market because of international \u2013 specifically China. China\u2019s a huge market that console games, traditional games, have not been able to break into. \n\nQ: How do you provide the immersed gaming experience you get from playing on a desktop or console to people playing on their phones? \n\nA: That\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re trying to pioneer. We just released a game seven months ago called \u201cMarvel: Contest of Champions,\u201d which is a fighting game that had some light story elements. And really it\u2019s about making it a game \u2013 it\u2019s not a mobile game being an apology. So we\u2019re trying to push more the true, classic video game experiences inside of a phone. And that does mean that if we\u2019re making an RPG (role playing game), we have to tell our story a little differently \u2013 our pacing\u2019s very different. \n\nQ: \u201cStar Wars: Uprising\u201d will be free to download and play. How does Kabam make money through the game? \n\nA: The basis of free to play is everybody can download it because we want as many people as possible to start playing it. And, really, the core of free play is being able to offer people what we call \u201cpay against the grind.\u201d So if you want to do something in the game, and it\u2019s going to take you a couple of extra hours \u2013 it\u2019s not like a timer, but let\u2019s say I have to run 10 dungeons \u2013 there\u2019s a route to kind of make that a lot shorter. It\u2019s optional. \n\nQ: How does the game fit within the \u201cStar Wars\u201d storyline? \n\nA: \u201cStar Wars: Uprising\u201d is set in the Anoat Sector, which you could call the \u201cEmpire Strikes Back\u201d sector. So it\u2019s Hoth, Cloud City, the planets around there. And it\u2019s right after \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d So this is time that nobody has explored in games. Basically, after the emperor, Death Star II, and the emperor is killed, the governor of the system, Governor Adelhard, basically puts an iron blockade down. Now, he\u2019s an imperialist. He believes that what the Empire\u2019s doing is truly great for the galaxy. And he puts a blockade that prevents trade, that prevents rebel propaganda. But ultimately you\u2019re pushing back against Adelhard\u2019s iron blockade. And there\u2019s five factions. The Rebel Alliance is one of the factions. \n\nQ: Is it completely open-ended, or is there a way to win the game? \n\nA: I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s winning, because it\u2019s a living world. But clearly you want to win, you want to beat the Empire. And we don\u2019t really look at it as just a game or a packaged product. This is a service, and we want to create the Star Wars community, the place for everyone to live their \u201cStar Wars\u201d dream. So how you push back against the Empire is part of the game, and one of the parts that will evolve. And as the community reacts, t\u2026","title":"A video game fan brings \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to your smartphone","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-13T02:09:48Z"}

There\u2019s a rap interlude from Lunch Money Lewis; a sexy duet with pop star Jordin Sparks. \n\nThe artist blaring from the speakers sat just outside the listening session \u2014 too nervous, he said, to watch people take in tracks from his sophomore album \u2018Tangled Up.\u2019 He strides in when it\u2019s over, bedroom eyes scanning the room for a reaction. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d the group initially declares before the question on everyone\u2019s mind gets asked. \n\nThe son of 90\u2019s country singer and Nashville songwriter Rhett Akins, Rhett made his debut in 2013 with \u2018bro\u2019 songs like \u2018Get Me Some of That\u2019 and \u2018It Goes Like This\u2019 \u2014 his star seemingly reliant on the dirt road theme of the day. But in the past year, Rhett\u2019s undergone a metamorphosis: first with his BeeGees-inspired \u2018Make Me Wanna\u2019 and then with \u2018Crash & Burn,\u2019 the Sam Cooke-style debut single off a forthcoming record that marries soul, pop, disco, electronic dance music (EDM) and a dash of rap with what\u2019s typically known as country. \n\nThe single Rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising, biggest selling song. And nestled in the Country Billboard Top 10 this summer betwixt hits like Sam Hunt\u2019s party-hearty \u2018House Party\u2019 and \u2018Like a Wrecking Ball,\u2019 the soulful sex-jam from Erich Church, his risk at least feels of the moment. There is comfort in acknowledging the chart-busting success of genre-blurring acts like Florida Georgia Line (who Rhett has supported on tour), Luke Bryan and Hunt, whose nearly pure-pop and R&B debut album has made him something of a (controversial) pioneer. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating\u201d Rhett said in an interview, reflecting on his move away from \u201cbro\u201d and towards something entirely new. \u201cSomeone the other day was like \u2018Man, I don\u2019t know if you know this, but I feel like you\u2019re on the brink of leading a new direction of music. \n\n\u2019\u201d \n\nBut in the minds of traditionalists, a new direction isn\u2019t something to which a country musician should aspire. To guys like Kyle Coroneos, who runs the website SavingCountryMusic.com, country is a genre not to be tampered with. Country music is about preserving tradition. It always has been and always will be. \n\nHe calls this disco\/EDM iteration a \u201cbro-hangover.\u201d The idea that bringing other genre-influences into country right now is risky, or pushing the envelope, or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous, he says. Instead, it contributes to one giant \u201cmono-genre,\u201d which he believes the merging of hip-hop and country has become. \n\n\u201cThe risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries, you begin to lose control of the music, you begin to lose control of your identity,\u201d he said. \u201cCountry music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions \u2014 no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year, not even rock or EDM or rap. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe genre-blending and trend-chasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio, he said. \u201cIn the 1990s and early 2000s, rock became the catch-all phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded. I think it could happen\u201d with country music. \n\nRhett doesn\u2019t believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music. \u201cWe\u2019re one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is a little bit scared to poke that bubble, because we\u2019re worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks,\u201d said Rhett. \u201cTo me, I want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me side-stage, they\u2019ll say \u2018Dang, I can\u2019t believe they just did that in their concert.\u2019 Or they hear a song on the record and go \u2018How in the world did they cut that song and get away with it?\u2019 There\u2019s something kind of rebelliously fun about it. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe cites mainstream country rebel Church as inspiration, his latest rock-influenced record \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 is stacked with successful radio hits, despite its many middle-finger-to-the-man moments. But in the minds of critics, that rebelliousness is a far cry from the stuff of Willie & Waylon and more indicative of Nashville chasing the next biggest money-making thing. \n\nDespite all of the pop experimentation, the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes: There\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 country and there\u2019s that crap you hear on the radio. But if you\u2019re going to refer to something as \u2018real\u2019 country, you have to have a definition of what \u2018real\u2019 country is. \n\nIf Thomas Rhett wants to put out an album in the style of Bruno Mars and have EDM and R&B stuff \u2026 I am 100% for it. You go, Thomas Rhett. You do that. But don\u2019t do it and sell it to country fans \n\nCountry music\u2019s identity is very much rooted in geography \u2014 there\u2019s Texas Swing out of the Lone Star State; there\u2019s Kentucky bluegrass, there\u2019s The Bakersfield Sound in California, which was a grittier, more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of Countrypolitan Nashville. \n\nPerhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is a little reminiscent of the origins of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2014 the combination of blues, country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons. While Rhett\u2019s hip gyrations are the closest he\u2019ll ever get to Elvis, maybe his Bruno Mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in a good way \u2014 reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines. \n\nAnd if there would be no rock \u2018n roll without blues, country and gospel, there would be no co\u2026","title":"Thomas Rhett pulls a Swift: Is country music\u00a0still country music when rap, soul and EDM are included?","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-14T16:24:01Z"}

With its clump of bubble-shaped rooms, the home seemed to spring out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. \n\nGrey quickly realized, \u201cI just don\u2019t have another house that\u2019s like this. \n\n\u201d \n\nThat didn\u2019t make the property a white elephant, though. \n\nWhen Grey asked several real estate agents in the Bay Area whether there was a market for the unusual home, he recalled, \u201cThe consensus was there\u2019s constant demand. \n\n\u201d \n\nSure enough, a buyer snapped it up for $800,000. \n\nNearly two decades later, the quirky marvel \u2013 remodeled and enhanced \u2013 is on the market again, this time for $4.2 million. \n\nIt\u2019s one of several out-of-the-ordinary dwellings that have been making headlines lately. \n\nIn the Mojave Desert, a house shaped like a spaceship and set on the 150-foot cinder cone of an extinct volcano was listed at $650,000 earlier this month and went into escrow Friday. The property, on 60 acres with a lake, got multiple offers. In Beverly Hills, a sprawling compound touted as the priciest home in the U.S. last year just took a $46 million price cut. \n\nDespite their differences, houses like these raise a common question: How does anyone \u2013 real estate professionals, sellers or buyers \u2013 figure out what off-the-wall, over-the-top homes are worth? \n\nThe Volcano House was owned by TV personality Huell Howser, who gave it to Chapman University in 2012, a year before his death. The university had originally planned to use the house for desert studies, astronomy and geology pursuits. But it\u2019s selling the property because its desert location, in Newberry Springs east of Barstow, was deemed too isolated for students. \n\nBrady Sandahl of Hom Sotheby\u2019s International Realty says he and another agent listing the house considered other \u201carchitecturally significant\u201d properties, mostly in the high desert, in coming up with the $650,000 price tag. \n\n\u201cYou just develop a business gut as to what you think the market will capture,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you turn to the buyers, and they\u2019ll tell you why they\u2019re giving you what they\u2019re giving you. That\u2019s the beauty of an open market. \n\n\u201d \n\nSandahl said the multiple offers he received show the asking price was appropriate; three offers came in at $650,000 or more. \n\nBut clearly, the price tag would be higher if the property wasn\u2019t so remote. \n\n\u201cThis is real estate,\u201d said Grey, who appraised the Flintstone House. \u201cThe first three rules of real estate are location, location, location. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe Flintstone House is on the opposite side of that rule. It\u2019s 17 miles from San Francisco and right near I-280, a major freeway. \n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the yard of the Flintstone House,\u201d Grey said, \u201cyou hear that freeway very clearly. \n\n\u201d \n\nWhile the noise outside the home is a minus, on the plus side, Grey said, the house itself is nearly soundproof: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a cave. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe attributes that to the construction. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were built over large inflated weather balloons then covered with gunite, or \u201cshotcrete.\u201d He said that makes the walls thicker than a typical home\u2019s. \n\nAppraising even unusual homes involves the basics, Grey said. Size, number of rooms, quality of finishes and condition are all factors considered in addition to location. \n\n\u201cThose are relevant to any house, no matter how unusual or historical or plain it is,\u201d he said. \n\nTHE COMPS \n\nWith no truly comparable homes, Grey said, he used a bracketing system to determine where the Flintstone House fit on a spectrum. He placed the area\u2019s high-end Tudor homes and plain ranch homes at opposite ends. \n\n\u201cAppraising something \u2026 it\u2019s quite a bit more art than science,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of appraising that house, I put it right in the middle. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe did not make comparisons with unusual homes elsewhere in the country, he said. \n\nWith land value varying greatly, he explained, \u201cYou could be avoiding an adjustment regarding the design of the house and making a huge adjustment for the difference in location. \n\n\u201d \n\nIn Southern California, Realtors Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International cast a considerably wider net to come up with Palazzo di Amore\u2019s $195 million price tag, which has since dropped to $149 million. \n\nThe agents said they looked to the most expensive homes worldwide. \n\nThe 25-acre compound with its own vineyard in Beverly Hills was touted as the most expensive in the U.S. when it came on the market last year. \n\nThe gated, 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property was eight years in the making. It\u2019s reached by a quarter-mile, tree-lined drive and has a guard station.
